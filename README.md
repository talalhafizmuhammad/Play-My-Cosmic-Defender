# 🚀 Play My Cosmic Defender

**Play My Cosmic Defender** is an arcade-style 2D space shooter developed in Python using Pygame. Navigate your starship, eliminate enemy waves, collect power-ups, and defend the cosmos in a fast-paced, action-packed environment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modular, object-oriented Python game structure:

- **Objective:** Survive escalating enemy waves while maximizing score
- **Gameplay Loop:** Player movement → Shooting → Collisions and effects → Power‑ups → Score & lives tracking
- **Scaffolding:** Clean separation of concerns via modules (e.g. `player`, `enemy`, `projectile`, `powerup`, `settings`)

By presenting a functional 2D shooter, it illustrates game loop design, collision detection, animation handling, and scalable code architecture.

## ✨ Features & Technologies Used

### ✅ Game Features

- Enemy waves that become progressively harder  
- Player spaceship with keyboard controls, shooting, and collision detection  
- Score tracking, life system, and game-over screen  
- Animations for explosions and power-up effects  
- Randomly spawning power-ups (e.g., extra life, rapid-fire, shields)

### 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python** (version 3.6+)
- **Pygame** for rendering, input handling, and game loop mechanics
- Asset organization (`assets/` or `images/` folder for sprites and sounds)
- Modular design: separate Python modules/files for main components
- Optional sound effects (`.wav`/`.ogg`) and background music
- IDE support: VS Code or any Python-friendly editor

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.6+
- **Graphics/Game Engine:** Pygame
- **Development Tools:** Any IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, Thonny, etc.)
- **Assets Folder:** Consistent naming for all images and sounds

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer  
- Pygame installed

Install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame

Set Up & Running
Download the project (e.g. via ZIP or Git clone)

Navigate to the project directory in terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd Play-My-Cosmic-Defender
Launch the game:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
(Replace main.py with your project's actual startup file if different.)

🎮 Gameplay Instructions
Movement: Arrow keys or WASD

Shooting: Spacebar or Control

Power‑ups: Collected automatically when flying over them

Lives & Score: Displayed on HUD; extra life resets the life counter

Game Over: Triggered when player loses all lives, then display score and restart option

🎮 Gameplay Instructions
🔼/🔽/◀️/▶️ Move the spaceship

🔫 Press Spacebar to fire

🎁 Collect power-ups for shields, extra lives, and more

💥 Avoid enemy fire and don’t let them pass!

🧮 Track your score at the top-left of the screen

☠️ Lose all lives → Game Over!

🧠 Code Overview
Briefly explain responsibilities of each module:

main.py – initializes game, main loop, event handling

player.py – Player class with movement, shooting, collision logic

enemy.py – Enemy behaviors, wave spawning, difficulty scaling

projectile.py – Manages bullets/projectiles movement and collision

powerup.py – Defines power-up types, spawning triggers, effects

settings.py – Configuration constants: screen size, frame rate, asset paths

Feel free to expand this once you know exact file names and structures.
